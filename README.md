<h1>Recursive Punks</h2>
Recursive Punks is one of the first 10k Recursive ordinals collections. 
The original Punks are being recreated by combining different pre-inscribed traits. 
Mint is 100% free. Find the punk you want in the SVG folder and inscribe the SVG file to claim it.

<h2>How to check if a Recursive Punks is already inscribed?</h2>
To check if a Recursive Punk is already inscribed, go to <a href="https://ordinalsbot.com/" target="_blank">OrdinalsBot.com</a>, use the "Hash Check" and upload your svg. If OrdinalsBot is not working check the <a href="https://bitpunks.io/Explorer/Inscriptions">BitPunks explorer</a> (bottom left). If there are inscriptions on the right, the svg is already inscribed!</a></i></p>

<h2>How do these ‘recursive inscriptions’ work?</h2>
<p>All punk traits have been inscribed in ordinals (view them <a href="https://ordiscan.com/address/bc1p2wrnw6gkyapz67s7ew422z5j9wt442t48day79pe5lv275at5phqlpn9cn" target="_blank">here</a>).<br> 

These traits are being combined into a new inscription to regenerate the original punks into an svg file.</p>
